Maintainer: Alexandr Gerasymenko

In this demo repository you find full version of my CV (which, frankly speaking, I'm prepared for
one of Dnipropetrovsk outsourcing companies, but requirements are mismatch with my skill's, so I'm
keep search for a job where I can apply my knowledges and be helpful for the team), modified file 
sysctl.conf, my nginx configuration and apache benchmark result for this system, script for view 
general system information, folder with screen-shots various services which I tested on my VM.

Also I'm write some like a essay "Everybody Need's DevOps" about DevOps, high availability and 
performance but think here is too much text to read, so if you will be interested in my candidature
we can discuss about it at the interview.

Have a nice time!
